		<h3>Adventure is out there.</h3>
		<p>
			What if we all ate pizza every day? How far could we go as a society, if our nutrition came from pizza alone? Imagine the possibilities. Imagine the kinds of pizza we could have. There could be chocolate pizzas, pea-zzas, banana pizzas, ice pizzas. There could be pizza shops each with 500 kinds of pizza on every street corner, in every city, in every nation. McDonald's would serve pepperoni on their burgers, which would be known as pizza sandwiches.
		</p>
		<h3>And what about dogs?</h3>
		<p>
			Here I am, senior year. I'm lost in the building where I've had almost all of my classes. Broken up, deep inside the fine arts building.
